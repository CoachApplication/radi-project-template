# SECURITY 
#
# This file defines a sequential set of security rules which should
# be applied to the project.
#
# @NOTE while it is not considered secure to use a local file to 
#   manage local security, this file will also used as an import
#   source for application of these rules in a production environment
#   where the yml may get imported into any config source.
