# USER
#
# This file defines the local user for the purposes
# of authentication.
#
# In any production system, the user authentication
# would be done with a better approach, but this 
# could facilitate a simple config based approach
# using an ssh based approach.
#
# @NOTE this file doesn't make sense in the project
# folder, and should go into the user's home kraut
# folder.
#
#  either (checked in this order):
#    ~/Library/kraut/
#    ~/.config/kraut/
#    ~/.kraut/
#

# @NOTE This is not a place for secrets, just for
#   user definition
# @NOTE we should probably try to come up with some
#   PAM/$(whoami) based defaults
